# Demo-1
Robot must perform three different tasks.
Each task is assigned to a team member(s) based on their roles in the team (Raspberry Pi or Arduino)
* Detect and recognize a beacon, and report the angle in degrees between the camera axis (i.e. an arrow pointing out of the camera perpendicular to the camera face) and the beacon. The angle is signed, with a positive angle when the beacon is to the left of the camera axis.
* Move forward in a straight line and stop after a specified distance in feet (between 1 and 10 feet).
* Rotate the robot by a specified angle in degrees, and move forward 1 foot.
